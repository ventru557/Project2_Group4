## Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of data analysis and machine learning techniques for credit risk assessment. We explore a rich dataset of borrower financial attributes to predict credit grades and identify factors influencing creditworthiness. The ultimate goal is to compare models and optimize performance for real-world applications.

---

## How We Picked the Dataset

The dataset was chosen from a credit risk analysis repository due to its detailed representation of real-world financial attributes. It includes data on borrowers, loan statuses, and credit grades, making it ideal for predictive modeling of financial risk.

---

## Difficulties and Concerns

- **High Dimensionality**: The dataset initially had 74 columns, many of which were irrelevant or redundant.
- **Class Imbalance**: Most entries were categorized as "Fully Paid," which could bias the model.
- **Data Quality**: Some columns had over 50% missing values, complicating the cleaning process.

---

## Adjustments Based on Feedback

Feedback from the instructor highlighted the importance of focusing on:
- Key financial attributes directly affecting credit risk.
- Simplifying the dataset by removing unnecessary features.
- Using additional feature engineering to derive meaningful insights.

---

## How and Why We Removed Data

- **Dropped Columns**: Removed columns like `id`, `member_id`, and `url` as they were irrelevant.
- **Dropped Rows**: Eliminated rows with excessive missing values to ensure data quality.
- **Sampling**: Used 15% of the data for quicker computation while maintaining sufficient diversity.

---

## Methodology

1. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created new features: `funded_amnt_to_annual_inc` and `revol_bal_to_annual_inc`.
   - Encoded categorical features like `term`, `grade`, and `loan_status`.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Visualized key feature distributions and relationships.
   - Correlation analysis to identify impactful features.
3. **Model Training**:
   - Split data into training and testing sets.
   - Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.
   - Trained multiple models: XGBoost and Random Forest.

---

## Models Used

### Why XGBoost and Random Forest?
- **XGBoost**:
  - High performance with gradient boosting.
  - Handles missing values and is robust to overfitting.
- **Random Forest**:
  - Ensemble method that performs well on imbalanced datasets.
  - Provides feature importance metrics for interpretability.

---

## Results

### Model Performance
- **Random Forest**: Achieved a testing accuracy of 96.2%.
- **XGBoost**: Delivered near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-scores.

### Key Insights
- `int_rate` (interest rate) is the most influential predictor of credit grade.
- Feature engineering and scaling significantly improved model performance.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate hyperparameter tuning for Random Forest and XGBoost.
- Validate with additional datasets for broader applicability.
- Develop a live dashboard for real-time credit scoring.
